# rh app deploy

```
Usage:
rh app deploy

```

Sends the app defined by `rehostapp.yml` and trigggers the deployment pipeline on Rehost Servers. All deployment urls will be shown in the end on successful deployment.

If the app was already deployed, it will overwrite the changes.

**Note:** `rehostapp.yml` should be present in the current directory.
